# AI Rock Paper Scissors

This repository features a simple implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game against an AI opponent in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your choice when prompted: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The AI will randomly select its choice.
4. The winner is determined based on the game rules.
5. You have the option to play again.

## Code Overview

The game is structured as follows:

- The `get_user_choice()` function prompts the user for their choice, ensuring it is a valid option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
- The `get_ai_choice()` function randomly selects the AI's choice from the available options.
- The `determine_winner(user_choice, ai_choice)` function decides the winner based on the Rock Paper Scissors rules.

The game continues in a loop, allowing the player to make choices and play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the Rock Paper Scissors showdown against the AI!
